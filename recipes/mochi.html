    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Mochi are small, sweet Japanese cakes made with glutinous rice flour (mochiko).<br>They have a soft, chewy outer layer and a deliciously sticky filling made of sweetened red bean paste.<br> Freezing the red bean paste before you use it is optional but it does make the process easier.</p>
